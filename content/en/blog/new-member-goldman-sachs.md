As part of launching the Open Source Program Office, Goldman Sachs has recently joined the TODO Group.

Goldman Sachs has been contributing to open source for nearly a decade and finding new ways to advance and scale in their Open Source Journey. 
In August, Goldman Sachs formalized its commitment to open source and created an Open Source Program Office (OSPO).

> As we have seen work well at other companies, having a single team responsible for the open source strategy will allow us to accelerate and deepen our investment in open source.
> Joining the TODO group will allow us to learn from and collaborate on open source tooling and processes with other organizations and companies. Coupled with informal ambassadorships 
> we're putting together to stay connected with other OSPOs both in financial services and in other industries, the TODO group will provide us a way to learn from what others have put in place to support their internal and external developer communities.

From the TODO Group, we hope to keep adding value to the OSPO community and TODO Members like Goldman Sachs and be the place to share tips around OSPO topics with other open source proffessionals worldwide.
